Develop a simple expense tracker using Python, MySQL, and TKinter. The system should allow users to 
add, view, update, and delete expense records in a MySQL database. The user interface should be 
designed using TKinter and should have the following functionalities:
 A main window with buttons to add, view, update, and delete expense records.
 A form to add new expense records with fields for expense description, amount, and date.
 A table view to display the list of expense records, including their details.
 Buttons to update and delete expense records.
 Filter functionality to filter expenses by date, amount, or description.
 Proper validation to handle empty fields, invalid inputs, and duplicate expense records
